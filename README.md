Background: The firm was founded in September 2014 by Michael Katchen and is based in Toronto. The idea of the company started back when Michael Katchen was working for 1000Memories, a Silicon Valley-based startup. After Ancestry.com bought 1000Memories in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spreadsheet helped inspire the idea for Wealthsimple. In 2014, he returned to Toronto to launch the company. The company original idea is providing smart, simple investing, without the high fees and account minimums associated with traditional investment management.  In December 2015, Wealthsimple merged with Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc., a Canadian order-execution only broker-dealer. Through the acquisition Wealthsimple became an owner of one of Canada's 14 discount brokerages (2015). The acquisition of Canadian ShareOwner Investment Inc. resulted in the assets under management comprising CA$400,000,000 across 10,000 customer accounts

In April 2015, the firm received $10 million from Power Financial Corporation in an agreement structured to allow for a future investment of $20 million within 12 months. In total, Power Financial Corporation has invested $30 million in Series A funding.

## Results

* Wealthsimple made investing very accessiable with no minimum for openning an account. Yet, the company does not seem to perform well when it is compared to others. Moneysense do not rate them one of the top, stock or etf trading, not user experiencem or any other thing.  They even rate them second in fees.  
They explain it as follows:Simply put, if there are no commission charges, then the brokerage is earning fees elsewhere. Perhaps it’s through inflated foreign exchange rates, limited or delayed market data, or orderflow partners (where the firm gets paid for each order they send to a partner for processing). Take, for example, U.S. online investing platform Robinhood, which was recently called out for its trade routing and discretionary stock availability while receiving compensation for its order flow (industry talk for earning fees in exchange for directing clients’ orders for execution). 

## Recommendations

They need to re-evaluate the no-fee actual cost and either put some fee or find a way to give generate money to cover their no fee policy without compromising service.
